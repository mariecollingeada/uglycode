# Ugly code to clean code refactoring

* In this exercise you will be cleaning up and refactoring ugly, obfuscated code.
* The code does some maths-y things...
* Analyse and understand the code.
* There are some tests included if you get stuck but don't look at them before you've tried to read the code!
* Refactor the code ensure the tests are still passing.
